# Presentation Guidelines

## Core Principles

- **Explore First** - Use Task agents to gather context from codebase
- **Structure Slides** - Organize findings into clear narrative flow
- **Visual Diagrams** - Create GraphViz diagrams for architecture and flows
- **Factory Pattern** - Use factory functions for automatic maxSteps calculation
- **Theme Consistency** - Extract and apply brand colors throughout

## Workflow

- **Create Presentation** - Explore codebase and generate markdown presentation, see [reference/presentation-create.md](reference/presentation-create.md)
- **Scaffold Package** - Convert markdown to Motion presentation package, see [reference/presentation-motion-scaffold.md](reference/presentation-motion-scaffold.md)

## Progressive Disclosure

- **Create presentation document** - Explore codebase and structure into slides, see [reference/presentation-create.md](reference/presentation-create.md)
- **Scaffold motion package** - Generate React+Motion package from markdown, see [reference/presentation-motion-scaffold.md](reference/presentation-motion-scaffold.md)
