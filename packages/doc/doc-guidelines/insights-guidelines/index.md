# Insights Guidelines

## Core Principles

- **Extract from Experience** - Analyze session for development errors and corrections, see [reference/insights-extract.md](reference/insights-extract.md)
- **Identify Patterns** - Find general patterns beyond current task
- **Document Structure** - Save with frontmatter for tracking and integration
- **Progressive Integration** - Convert insights into skill guidelines, see [reference/insights-integrate.md](reference/insights-integrate.md)

## Workflow

- **Extract** - Review conversation, document category/topic/mistake/discovery/fix, see [reference/insights-extract.md](reference/insights-extract.md)
- **Save** - Create separate files with frontmatter for each insight
- **Integrate** - Convert to progressive disclosure skills, mark as applied, see [reference/insights-integrate.md](reference/insights-integrate.md)

## Progressive Disclosure
