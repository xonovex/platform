## Agent Skills: Using Scripts in Skills

- **URL:** https://agentskills.io/skill-creation/using-scripts.md
- **Last reviewed:** 2026-05-13
- **Used for:**
  - `references/using-scripts.md` → entire file
- **Aspects extracted:**
  - One-off commands vs bundled scripts decision rule
  - Version pinning examples (npx@version, uvx@version, etc.)
  - `compatibility` frontmatter for runtime requirements
  - Self-contained scripts with inline deps: PEP 723 (Python), Deno `npm:`/`jsr:`, Bun auto-install, Ruby `bundler/inline`
  - Designing for agentic use: no interactive prompts, `--help`, helpful error messages, structured output (JSON/CSV), stdout vs stderr separation
  - Idempotency, closed-set inputs, `--dry-run`, meaningful exit codes, safe defaults, bounded output size

## Agent Skills: Evaluating Skill Output Quality

  - `scripts/eval-outputs.py` → with-skill/without-skill arms, LLM-as-judge grading, `benchmark.json`
- **Aspects extracted:**
  - Test case shape (prompt, expected output, optional input files) → Test Case Shape
  - Reference-guided binary LLM-as-judge with evidence; with-skill vs without-skill arms in isolated runs → `scripts/eval-outputs.py` (method also informed by public SkillsBench / skill-creator output-eval practice)
  - `evals/evals.json` storage convention
  - Workspace layout (`iteration-N/`, `with_skill/`, `without_skill/`) → Workspace Layout

  - Fresh context per run → Workflow
  - Timing capture (`total_tokens`, `duration_ms`) → Running Eval Pairs
  - Good vs weak assertions, evidence requirement → Writing Assertions

  - Iteration signals (failed assertions, feedback, transcripts) → Iteration Signals
  - "Stay lean, explain why, bundle repeated work" iteration principles

## Agent Skills: Specification

- **URL:** https://agentskills.io/specification.md
- **Last reviewed:** 2026-05-13
- **Used for:**
  - `SKILL.md` → Spec Constraints, Skill Structure
  - `references/validate.md` → Spec Constraints, Frontmatter Checks, Body Checks, Reference Checks
- **Aspects extracted:**
  - Frontmatter fields: required `name` (≤64 chars, kebab-case regex, matches parent dir), required `description` (≤1024 chars), optional `license` / `compatibility` (≤500 chars) / `metadata` / `allowed-tools`
  - Body recommended <500 lines / ~5000 tokens
  - Directory layout: `SKILL.md` + optional `scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/`
  - Progressive disclosure: metadata at startup, body on activation, resources on demand
  - File references one level deep, relative paths from skill root
  - Reference filename kebab-case convention

## Agent Skills: Equipping Agents for the Real World

  - `references/composability.md` → entire file
  - `references/catalog-audit.md` → entire file
- **Aspects extracted:**
