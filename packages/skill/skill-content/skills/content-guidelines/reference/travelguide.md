1. Introduction (200-300 words): Hook, key logistics, duration
2. Logistics (400-500 words): Location, hours, transport, tips
3. Attractions (500-600 words): 3-5 essential with access, duration, cost, hours, tip
4. Itineraries (600-800 words): Budget/family/premium types, half/full-day options
5. Practical Info (400-500 words): Payment, language, weather, safety, customs

Front-matter:

```yaml
