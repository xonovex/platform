# news: Auto-Curate Latest News Stories

**Guideline:** Research and write news stories in multiple languages with verified facts triangulated from 3+ sources.

**Rationale:** Bilingual news requires triangulating sources to discard clickbait while paraphrasing to avoid plagiarism and maintain credibility.

**Example:**

```yaml
---
title: "Headline (35-45 words)"
slug: "story-slug"
summary: "Concise summary"
created_at: "2024-01-24T12:00:00Z"
image_url: "royalty-free-url"
lang: "en"
---
```

Write in CEFR B1-B2 level with short sentences (<20 words) and bullet points for skimming.

**Techniques:**
- WebSearch verification: Find 3+ credible sources per story, use date filters
- Triangulate facts: Cross-check claims, discard unsourced or clickbait content
- Paraphrase: Never copy verbatim, use original wording while preserving meaning
- Language standards: Target CEFR B1-B2 with natural, concise prose
- Headlines: Write 35-45 word summaries that are authoritative yet friendly
- Filename format: Use `slug.lang.md` convention for bilingual organization
